# About

This is a blog. You know, a web log - a journal that you put online for anyone to read. "Eww, why would anyone want to do that!?" asked nobody. Late stage neoliberal capitalism has turned blogging into a lucrative means of promoting a brand, whether that brand is personal or business. This is **not** that kind of blog. This is just an innocent, no frills 90's style  blog where some guy on the Internet gets to rant. After all, why not.
